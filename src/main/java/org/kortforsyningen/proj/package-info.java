/**
 * Java Native Interface for the <a href="https://proj.org/">PROJ</a> C/C++ library.
 * PROJ is a generic coordinate transformation software that transforms geospatial
 * coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another.
 * This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations.
 * This package exposes PROJ services as implementations of <a href="http://www.geoapi.org">GeoAPI</a> interfaces.
 * Both PROJ and GeoAPI are modeled according the ISO 19111 international standard.
